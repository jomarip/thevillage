Villages Community Reinvestment Platform –
Frontend Specifications
Overview
This document provides a comprehensive frontend handoff for the Villages Community Reinvestment
Platform. It builds on the underlying Move‑based architecture and the UX flows described in the project’s
technical documentation. The goal is to provide a clear set of specifications and assets that a frontend
engineer can use to implement a polished, accessible, and maintainable web application.
The platform’s mission is to transform community participation (service hours and contributions) into
verifiable progress on neighborhood projects. To achieve this, the frontend must connect to wallets (Petra
or Aptos Connect), interact with Move modules via the provided API endpoints, and present
complex on‑chain flows in a way that’s easy for volunteers, staff, homeowners and external supporters to
understand.
1. Visual & Interactive Assets
High‑Fidelity Mockups
Although interactive prototypes are not provided in this document, the following list of core screens
defines the scope for a high‑fidelity design file (ideally created in Figma). These mockups should be
designed to WCAG AA accessibility standards, follow the design system described below, and include all
interactive states (empty, loading, populated, error, etc.).
Landing / Home – succinctly explains the purpose of the platform and invites users to connect a
wallet. Use the handshake hero graphic below as a branding element. Provide calls to action for
volunteers, homeowners, and supporters.
Wallet Connect Modal – allows users to choose Petra, Aptos Connect, or other supported wallets.
Include installation links when window.aptos is not detected .
Onboarding & KYC – guides users through social login and identity verification. Present a consent
screen explaining why KYC is required and how data is handled (off‑chain).
Volunteer Dashboard – displays current Time Dollar balance, pending service requests, approved
hours and redemption options. Contains flows to log service hours, view history, and stake
Time Dollars into projects.
Staff Dashboard – for validators and admins. Shows pending hour approvals, member
management, compliance controls, and treasury metrics.
Project Catalog – lists community projects (e.g., distressed homes) with progress bars, funding
goals and impact share statistics. Users can view details, contribute, and monitor milestones.
Project Detail – deep dive into a single project: description, images, milestones, service and funding
contributions, and a “stake/claim impact shares” call to action.

Governance & Voting – interface for proposals, voting and results. Include instructions for each
voting mechanism (token‑weighted, quadratic or conviction) .
Settings & Account – allow users to view their profile, connected wallets, roles, notifications
preferences and KYC status.
Design files should include user flow diagrams that map the sequence of screens for key journeys (e.g.,
volunteer logs hours → pending approval → Time Dollars minted → redeem for impact shares). The user
story map in the design sprint CSV provides a detailed breakdown of these flows and can be adapted into
diagrams.
Assets
All icons and images should be exported as SVG (or PNG for raster) with meaningful names. The following
assets are provided as part of this specification:
Asset Description Usage
A stylized handshake within a circle, using
deep purple and teal. This symbolises trust
and collaboration.
Use on the landing page banner,
headers or as a logo mark.
A minimal icon combining a clock and a
heart to represent Time Dollars
(time‑based credits earned through
service).
Use next to Time Dollar balances,
buttons to log hours, and tooltips
explaining the currency.
To generate additional assets (e.g., project thumbnails or decorative motifs), follow similar visual motifs:
simple shapes, smooth curves, and limited color palette.
2. Design System Specification
Color Palette
The palette balances the Village’s community‑oriented values with Aptos‑inspired hues. Define these as CSS
variables for easy theming.
Token Usage Hex
--color-primary Buttons, highlights, icons #5E3FA3 (deep purple)
--color-secondary Accents, links, callouts #00A0A6 (teal)
--color-success Success states, approved hours #4CAF50

Token Usage Hex
--color-error Error states, invalid inputs #E53935
--color-warning Warnings, pending statuses #FFB300
--color-background Page background #F8F8F8 (off‑white)
--color-surface Cards, modals #FFFFFF
--color-on-primary Text on primary surfaces #FFFFFF
--color-text Main text #333333
--color-muted Secondary text, hints #777777
Typography
Use sans‑serif fonts for readability and approachability. Suggested stack:
Headings (H1–H3): Inter , Segoe UI , Helvetica Neue , Arial , sans‑serif. Bold for H1
( 32 px ), semi‑bold for H2 ( 24 px ), medium for H3 ( 20 px ). Line heights of 1.25 to 1.3 .
Body: Inter , Roboto or system UI at 16 px with 24 px line height. Use a lighter weight
( 400 ).
Caption/Help text: 14 px with 20 px line height. Color should be --color-muted .
Spacing & Grid
Adopt an 8 px spacing system. All margins, padding and component gaps should be multiples of 8 ( 8 px ,
16 px , 24 px , 32 px ). Use a 12‑column grid for desktop layouts and a 4‑column grid for mobile.
Breakpoints
Define responsive breakpoints to ensure the UI adapts gracefully to various devices:
Name Width Description
sm
@media (min-width:
480px)
Small phones; single‑column layout, stacked cards.
md
@media (min-width:
768px)
Tablets; 2–3 columns, bottom navigation replaced with side
menu.
lg
@media (min-width:
1024px)
Small laptops; dashboard layouts with left sidebar, modals
anchored.
xl
@media (min-width:
1280px)
Desktops; 12‑column grid, multi‑panel dashboards.

UI Components & States
Document each reusable component with its variations. For each, specify default, hover, focus, active,
disabled, loading, and error states. Examples include:
Buttons – Primary (solid background), Secondary (outlined), Tertiary (text). Add aria-label
attributes for accessibility and show progress spinners when awaiting blockchain confirmations.
Inputs & Forms – Text fields, number inputs, date pickers. Label everything clearly; use inline
validation messages and icons for success/error. Provide accessible focus indicators.
Cards – Used for projects, requests, user summaries. Elevate with subtle shadows ( box-shadow:
0 2 4 rgba(0,0,0,0.1) ) and 8 px radius. Cards can be clickable; indicate this on hover by slightly
raising the card and darkening the shadow.
Navigation – Side navigation for desktop, bottom tab bar on mobile. Icons accompanied by labels.
Ensure enough contrast and larger touch targets (44 px). Highlight the current route with the
primary color.
Modals & Drawers – For flows like wallet connect, hour logging, redemption confirmation. Use
overlay backgrounds with 50 % opacity; trap focus inside modals to comply with accessibility
guidelines.
Table/List components – Display lists of approvals, contributions, members. Include sorting, filtering
and pagination controls. Support responsive stacking on smaller screens.
For each component, annotate any conditions or permissions (e.g., the “Approve” button in the staff
dashboard should appear only for users with the validator role and the address must be whitelisted ).
Icons & Illustrations
Use vector icons for clarity and scalability. Common actions such as wallet connection, KYC
verification, approval, and redemption should have consistent iconography.
The handshake and Time Dollar icons provided above serve as templates for the style: clean lines,
limited color palette, and minimal details.
Avoid using photographs of real people to ensure privacy and inclusivity. Instead, rely on simple
illustrations or abstract patterns.

Detection & onboarding – Check for window.aptos . If not present, show a link to install Petra
.
Connect / Disconnect – Use wallet.connect() to request connection and
wallet.disconnect() to sign out .
Transaction submission – Call signAndSubmitTransaction({ function:
"0x…::module::method", typeArguments: [], arguments: [...] }) and display clear
status messages (pending, succeeded, failed). In “gasless” mode, call your backend to request a
sponsored transaction and display a spinner while it completes .
Error handling – Capture errors from the adapter and present human‑readable messages; e.g.,
“Transaction rejected” if the user declines, or “Insufficient balance” if APT is needed for direct gas
payments.
State Management & Data Fetching
Use React Query or a similar library to manage asynchronous data from the REST API and indexer.
Poll transaction status until it reaches success .
Use GraphQL queries to fetch project lists, user balances, and event histories from the indexer. Cache
these results and refetch on demand.
For local development, provide fallback JSON files that mimic API responses. Replace them with real
network calls once contracts are deployed on testnet.

Switch the values to Mainnet for production deployment.
Accessibility & UX Best Practices
Keyboard navigation: Ensure every interactive element is reachable via keyboard. Provide focus
outlines and ARIA labels. Trap focus within modals.
Loading & confirmation: Always show progress indicators while waiting for blockchain
confirmations. Provide success and error notifications with descriptions and actions (e.g., “View on
Explorer”).
Progressive disclosure: Hide advanced features (e.g., gas fee inputs, governance options) by
default. Offer an “advanced mode” toggle for power users.
Plain language: Use simple explanations when dealing with blockchain concepts, such as “Add
Time Dollars to Project” instead of “Stake tokens” .
Responsive design: Test layouts on phones, tablets, and desktops. Provide larger touch targets and
avoid horizontal scrolling.
Color contrast: Use the color palette to meet or exceed WCAG AA contrast ratios. Never rely solely
on color to convey meaning; pair colors with icons or text.
4. Component Library & States
Below is an overview of key components and their states. In the design file, create a Component Library
page where each is documented with its variants.
Button
State Appearance Interaction
Default Solid primary background with white text; 8 px
radius
On hover, darken the background
slightly; on focus, show an outline.
Disabled Muted background and text; 40 % opacity; no
shadow
Cursor shows not-allowed and
clicking has no effect.
Loading Replace label with spinner; maintain width Display while awaiting transaction
confirmation.
Success
For actions that change state, briefly change
background to --color-success and show a
checkmark.

Hover Card elevates and reveals additional actions (e.g., “View details”, “Contribute”).
Completed Progress bar filled; show checkmark and label “Completed”.
Disabled Gray out and display reason (e.g., “Project closed”).
Modal
Type Use case
Confirm
Transaction
Before calling signAndSubmitTransaction , display summary: function name
(human‑readable), cost (Time Dollars or gas), and user’s balances.
Success / Error After transaction completes; show transaction hash and link to indexer or explorer.
Input Form
For logging service hours or submitting project details; embed the input fields
described above.
Toast Notifications
Implement a toast system (bottom‑right on desktop, top‑center on mobile) for transient messages:
Info – e.g., “Submitting your request…” with spinner.
Success – e.g., “Hours approved. 5 Time Dollars minted!” with a green icon.
Error – e.g., “Transaction failed: network error” with a red icon.
Warning – e.g., “Relayer unavailable; switching to direct mode.”

5. Next Steps for Frontend Implementation
Create a Figma file using these specifications. Organize it into pages: Components, Mockups, Flows,
Style Guide. Define components as reusable symbols with constraints.
Build the React/Next.js project. Install the @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react package and
set up environment variables. Scaffold pages and components using a UI framework like Chakra UI
or Tailwind CSS, customizing tokens to match the palette above.
Integrate with the Move modules. Use the provided TypeScript SDK or direct REST calls to interact
with the registry_hub , timebank , treasury , project_registry , etc. Fetch data from the
indexer GraphQL endpoint for project lists, event histories and balances. Use view functions on
the Move modules for deterministic reads.Aptos
Implement the relayer logic. When the user is in gasless mode, forward transactions to the
backend service which signs them and pays gas. Provide a fallback to direct transactions when the
relayer is unavailable.
Set up analytics and logging. Track user actions (connect wallet, log hours, contribute, vote)
anonymously to identify friction points. Respect privacy and regulatory requirements; do not store
PII.
Conduct usability testing. Test with HCV staff and volunteers. Gather feedback on navigation
clarity, terminology, and accessibility. Iterate based on findings before moving to mainnet.
Conclusion
The Villages Community Reinvestment Platform is more than a dApp—it is a civic tool designed to empower
communities through transparent, on‑chain participation. A thoughtful frontend design that blends modern
web standards with blockchain‑specific interactions is critical to its success. This specification provides the
foundation for a frontend engineer to implement a best‑in‑class, accessible user experience that scales
from initial pilots on testnet to broader deployments on mainnet.
